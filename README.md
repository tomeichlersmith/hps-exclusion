## Install
I don't plan to publish this package to PyPI but you can still install it from source.
For easier bug reporting, I would request that you install from a tag so that it is
obvious what source code you are using.
```
git clone --branch <tag> https://github.com/tomeichlersmith/hps-exclusion.git
pip install --user hps-exclusion/
```
